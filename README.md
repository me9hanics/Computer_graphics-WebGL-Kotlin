AIT Budapest: Spring Semester 2021
Computer Graphics in Kotlin + WebGL

These projects are the (upgraded) versions of a few homeworks under the AIT - Computer Graphics course. The aim of the course wasn't teaching Kotlin and WebGL, but the basics and basis of (programmed) computer graphics. What you need to know about the making of these projects:
These are not projects started from total 0. We were given the webglmath folder filled with great classes and functions, to ease our work. These files were edited by me, but were given to us since the beginning: App.kt, TriangleGeometry.kt, KeyNames.kt, Program.kt, Shader.kt, WebGL2RenderingContext.kt, solid-fs.glsl, idle-vs.glsl and later Texture2D.kt.
I use VSCode for code editing, and Gradle for build. (from the command line)
These projects were only hosted as an http localhost.

The repo includes:

-a 2D Camera usage project

-a 2D game (working, but misses on some features)

-3D projects.

To run these files, you need to install Gradle, and from the command line, run "gradle build" in the folder the files are contained in. After this, you can just host the web files, for example with XAMPP, but I recommend the commandline for this as well.
