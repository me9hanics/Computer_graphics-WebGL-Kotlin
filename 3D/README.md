2.1: 

Procedural Solid Texturing: Wood and a somewhat marble Slowpoke
Ground with rainbow colors

Problems:
Shadow: 1. Plane projected shadow: Theoretically, it's done, but it doesn't show up
                   2. Projecting from a point of light: Same problem (would be activated by pressing L)
Camera: Third person, by pressing P. Something not right, I changed the rotation values (theoretically, I think the avatar's yaw should be 180Â° more than the camera's yaw, so they face each other, and the camera should rotate accordingly to the yaw value)
