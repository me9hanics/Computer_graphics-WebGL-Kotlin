Duplicate doesn't work, because I have trouble importing the clone function, but I wrote the function which should (?) work if .clone() worked and cloned the instance.
I also think duplication may be solved by copying the whole selectedgameObject arraylist, but I didn't find the method of copying the arraylist.
